# STM-Calibration-

This repository contains code for Method 2: Tip Calibration Approach specifically designed for STM tip calibration on Au(111) surfaces. The approach employs controlled crashes as the primary conditioning action to recalibrate the tip and maintain image quality during scanning. This method provides a practical calibration solution, focusing on simplicity and reproducibility.

Please note that the code is currently based on an earlier version and may require updates to integrate the latest enhancements for optimal performance.
